        <p>Driving on icy roads can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>While most others simply suggest avoiding frozen roads altogether, sometimes it is necessary to face Mother Nature’s wrath and test your luck out on the frozen pavement. Although it’s different from what I usually write about on this blog, having to drive in these conditions myself has compelled me to offer a few pointers to you guys. And thus, I have compiled this list of tips for driving on icy roads from my own personal experience and from other sources.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make sure your tires have plenty of tread. The more, the better.</strong> This is incredibly important. If your tires don’t have enough tread (6/32-inch, according to The Tire Rack), drive another car that does, or get another ride. It’s difficult enough driving with worn tires in the light rain, let alone driving over a thick sheet of ice. No tread is equivalent to no traction, which is a recipe for disaster when dealing with frozen roads.</li>
<li><strong>Get a feel for braking and steering.</strong> Cars handle differently in ice. Because of this, you’ll want to drive as slowly and cautiously as possible until you get used to how your vehicle stops and turns. And even when you think that you’ve got the hang of it, don’t get too comfortable - a slippery spot could be waiting for you just up ahead.</li>
<li><strong>Take the busier roads.</strong> Common sense. The more cars that are driving on a certain road, the smaller chance that ice will form. Also, the higher-traffic roadways usually have greater priority when it comes to deicing. Keep this in mind when planning your commute.</li>
<li><strong>If you get stuck, don’t spin your wheels.</strong> It doesn’t work. Trust me. Also, don’t panic. Try shifting into reverse to see if you’re able to move backwards. If that doesn’t work, try pouring sand, salt, or kitty litter in your path. If you’re still stuck, you may want to call for help.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid overpasses, if possible. </strong>Actually, ignore that “if possible” part. It’s almost always possible to avoid tall freeway overpasses. Sure, using an alternate route may take a little longer, but it’s significantly less hazardous and nerve-wracking. Plan accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t rely too much on technology.</strong> Anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control are helpful on icy roads, sure - but they’re not going to make driving in the ice an effortless endeavor. Read your owners manual and learn how these technologies work. If you have ABS, apply full pressure to the brakes in order to stop in icy conditions. If not, gently pump the brakes until you come to a stop.<br>Well, that’s all I’ve got. Remember to keep your full attention on driving at all times, and be safe out there!</li>
</ol>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Once upon a time, a man named Dwight D. Eisenhower championed the formation of a little thing called the Interstate Highway System. Sure, you’ve probably heard of it, and most likely have even driven on it a few hundred times, but do you know what the original intent of this incredibly extensive network of concrete and pavement was? Sure, safety, congestion, and the advancement of the economy were all driving forces behind the development of the system (no pun intended), but national defense also played a significant role in conceptualizing this enormous undertaking. In the event of a catastrophe or emergency, Interstate highways could be used as an easy path of evacuation from major cities. Considering these original intentions, I wonder if Eisenhower would approve of what is happening to our highways in the 21st century?</p>
<p>What I’m primarily referring to here is the addition of tolled lanes to the preexisting main lanes on our highways. Sure, tolled Interstate highways aren’t new. Take I-95, for instance. Much of the northern portion of that highway has been tolled for decades now. What is particularly concerning, though, is the rampant spread of a relatively new concept called <em>express toll lanes</em>. Theses types of tolled highway lanes take various names around the country, but the basic premise is always the same; for a fee that gradually increases based on the amount of congestion on the toll lanes, drivers have access to completely separate lanes in the middle of the highway which promise for much speedier travel. Various Interstate highways around the country are starting to implement express toll lanes–I-95 in Maryland, I-495 around Washington, D.C., and I-635 around Dallas, for example.</p>
<p>Supporters say that these lanes will offer congestion improvements for all drivers and not just the ones paying for the tolled express lanes, but it that _really _the case? Take I-635, for example. The <a href="http://www.lbjexpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">LBJ Express</a> project promises to offer a vastly improved driving experience commuters in the highly-congested North Dallas area. Throughout the 13-mile implementation of tolled express lanes (called “TEXpress lanes” by the state), the project will offer 2-3 continuous tolled lanes along with continuous, rebuilt frontage roads. Sure, this seems fine at a first glance, but the numbers that are being offered just don’t add up for me. According to the LBJ Express project website, the current capacity of the highway is approximately 180,000 vehicles per day, and the demand in 2020 is expected to be at about 500,000 vehicles per day. Here’s my question: how will I-635 be able to comfortably handle nearly triple the previous capacity with only the addition of new frontage roads and tolled lanes that are designed to only handle a limited amount of traffic? That’s right, the new highway still has the <em>same amount of main lanes</em>. I would love to be proved wrong, but I expect to see I-635 continue to experience horrible congestion issues that can only be circumvented by <em>paying a fee</em>.</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_884” align=”aligncenter” width=”620”]<img src="http://www.roadcrazed.com/wp-content/uploads/LBJTEXPRESSLANES.jpg" alt="Will express toll lanes really improve traffic for the average commuter?"> Will express toll lanes really improve traffic for the average commuter?<br><em>Image source: Dallas Morning News</em>[/caption]</p>
<p>The way I see it, these types of highways are designed with monetary profit as a first priority, with the safety and ease of travel for the general public coming in second. I’m not going to go into a massive social class argument here, but in my personal opinion, express toll lanes just make life easier for those of us who can afford fluctuating highway tolls on a regular basis. For the rest of us, these types of highway reconstruction projects may only offer little to no real benefit. In my eyes, the only advantage of express toll lanes for the general public is the ability for quicker travel in the event of an excruciating circumstance or emergency situation. Still, I believe that we shouldn’t have to pay tons of money to get where we’re going in a decent amount of time. We should be investing in systems that make transportation easier and quicker for the general public, rather than  further expanding our highway footprint for the benefit of only a limited amount of people.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://transportationblog.dallasnews.com/2013/10/video-heres-how-fluctuating-toll-prices-on-635-will-work.html/" target="_blank" rel="external">this video</a> on the Dallas Morning News website to be both amusing and very angering. The woman in the video explains the TEXpress lanes while simultaneously acting like they’re the best thing since sliced bread. By taking the express lanes, the woman in the video makes it home to her unrealistically happy family more quickly. Perhaps the most frustrating part of the video, though, is the very beginning; the woman states that Dallas/Fort Worth is home to 25% of the most congested freeways in Texas, and that express toll lanes are an easy way to circumvent that. Here’s an idea: how about instead of throwing lots of tolls at the situation, we actually do something to try and improve that disgruntling statistic?</p>
<p>Clearly I’m an opponent to express toll lanes, but I’d love to hear some opposing views to the subject.

<p><em>Guest post by Vicki Dean. </em></p>
<p>Now 55 years old, the British motorways are for many a way of life, from the commuter to the trucker. A mass of traffic jams, closed junctions and speed cameras, they are needed by many but loved by few. However, there are plenty of strange oddities to be spotted up and down the country, from strange architecture to bizarre road structures. The British motorway has become in its own way a national treasure, and here are some reasons why:</p>
<p><strong>Magic Roundabouts </strong></p>
<p>There are several of them in the UK, but the most famous ‘magic roundabout’ is the original – located in Swindon. It boggles the mind to think this odd, overcomplicated concept caught on. Revolving around five mini roundabouts, there are two flows of traffic that run clockwise and counter clockwise right next to each other. The result has led to Swindon’s roundabout being voted one of the most dangerous junctions in the UK. During the roundabout’s pilot scheme, five policemen had to stand in the middle of each of the mini roundabouts to explain the concept to confused drivers. If you want to take on the challenge, other magic roundabouts can be found in Hemel Hempstead and Colchester in Essex.</p>

<p><strong>Spaghetti Junction </strong></p>
<p>Junction 6 off the M6, the road formally known as the Gravelly Hill Interchange is truly a UK motorway one off. Built to avoid disrupting the canals and rivers leading from Birmingham. Spaghetti Junction is a huge mass of twisted roads that knot in and out. Used by 200,000 motorists every day, most attest to the junction not being nearly as complicated as it looks. The junction is split across five levels and needs nearly 600 columns to support its reinforced steel structure. The phrase ‘Spaghetti Junction’, first coined by a local journalist, is now used to describe similar junctions throughout the world, but the Brum version is the original and most confusing.</p>

<p><strong>Chalfont Viaduct </strong></p>
<p>Constructed between 1902 and 1906, the Chalfont Viaduct is a rare example of a well preserved Edwardian brick building, hence its status as a listed building, despite running over the M25. However, what makes this motorway landmark so memorable is its graffiti, which reads the legend ‘Give Peas A Chance’. This appears to be a reference to a London based graffiti artist named Peas who had put his name on the bridge. The additional ‘Give’ and ‘A Chance’ were added to protest Peas getting arrested. The graffiti cannot be removed because of the structure’s listed status, meaning Peas will be remembered forever by Britain’s motorists.</p>

<p><strong>The Mancunian Way</strong></p>
<p>This road leading into Manchester central has a few little quirks which make it special, most notably the ‘road to nowhere’, which was a mistake in the council’s original design that was quickly stopped mid-construction, leading to a slip road simply hanging in mid-air. It is now (unsuccessfully) covered by an advertising billboard. The Mancunian Way is also home to the smallest motorway in the country, the A635 (M), a 300m long part of the Manchester ring road that has its own special title. It doesn’t exist on any maps, and its title comes from a single sign alongside the road. The Spaghetti Junction-esque Mancunian Way seems to be a result of some seriously bad planning, but Mancunians admire the elevated road greatly – with Take That even naming a song after the ring road.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Red Hill Filling Station </strong></p>
<p>This unassuming petrol station just outside of Leicester on the west of the A6 became a Grade 2 listed building in 2012. It is the last example in the UK of the iconic ‘Pegasus’ design, originally a concept rolled out to make Mobil brand stations stand out on the road. This distinctive design was conceived in the 60’s and has a memorable ‘flying saucer’ effect which makes this a pleasing little motorway oddity.</p>

<p><strong>Tebay Services </strong></p>
<p>When most of us think about service stations, we think searing hot coffee, a greasy bacon sandwich and mushy peas with skin an inch thick, all for a small fortune. Tebay services near Penrith in Cumbria like to do things differently. Instead of a Maccy D’s the family-run Tebay will serve you a hand pressed burger made from local meat, and you can drink a freshly ground coffee while looking out on the mountain views beyond their duck pond. The services also come with a well stocked farmers shop stuffed with great quality local produce for the road – better than a vacuum packed tuna mayo sarnie any day. Luxury motorway services never caught on, making Tebay a true original.</p>

<p><strong>Stott Hall Farm </strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.roadcrazed.com/wp-content/uploads/new1.jpg" alt="new"></p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Stott_Hall_Farm_(RLH" target="_blank" rel="external">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Stott_Hall<em>Farm</em>(RLH)_2009-08-13.JPG</a>_2009-08-13.JPG)</p>
<p>The M62 or ‘Trans Pennine Motorway’ is one of the most beautiful, if bleak, roads in England, passing from east to west across moorland and the Yorkshire countryside. However, at one point the directions of the road dramatically divide to make way for an isolated group of buildings – Stott Hall Farm that has stood in the same place near the village of Calderdale since 1737. Despite the legend that the tenants of the farm simply refused to move for the motorway, built in the early 1970’s, the farm remains simply due to a bit of good luck. Where hundreds of homes were torn down, Stott Hall was positioned a little too high for both of the roads to run alongside each other, so the design changed and the farm remained. It still functions as a farm to this day, with the farmer providing petrol and shelter for anyone who has broken down on the exposed Pennines!</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>When most of us picture a highway, an age-old image comes to mind: a big slab of concrete or asphalt with some stripes painted on it. Throw in some old-school streetlights and maybe a little landscaping here and there, and that’s essentially the definition of a traditional highway. Sticking to a tried-and-true system isn’t always a good thing, though. In this past 100 years we’ve seen automobiles go from inefficient, slow-moving deathtraps to increasingly safe, fuel-sipping technological powerhouses, but what about the structures that allow these vehicles to get anywhere? Apart from growing a little taller and a little wider over time, public highways have seen very little advancement in the past few decades. A particularly creative designer in The Netherlands is changing all of that, though.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.studioroosegaarde.net/project/smart-highway/" target="_blank" rel="external">Smart Highway</a> project, being developed by Studio Roosegaarde and infrastructure management group Heijmans, introduces a new type of roadway: one that illuminates itself. This type of highway uses “<a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/10/glowing-roads/?pid=2413" target="_blank" rel="external">photo-luminizing powder</a>“ that replaces road markings. It charges up during the daytime, and gives off up to 10 hours worth of light during the night. Special paint won’t just be used for the dividing lines, though–it will also be used to paint snowflake shapes on the road surface which will become visible in cold temperatures to caution drivers about possible slippery surfaces. Illuminated road markers aren’t the only useful feature that will be implemented on these highways, though. Other planned improvements within the next five years include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Priority induction lanes that charge electric vehicles</li>
<li>Interactive lights that switch on as cars pass</li>
<li>Wind-powered lights<br>[caption id=”attachment_849” align=”aligncenter” width=”512”]<img src="http://www.roadcrazed.com/wp-content/uploads/1447-4724-image.jpeg" alt="1447-4724-image"> Wind-powered roadside lighting is another major safety feature.[/caption]</li>
</ul>
<p>These features don’t need entirely new roadways to operate on, and can be implemented on current highways around the world. Roosegaarde hopes to have his designs implemented on the west coast of the United States, to possibly interact with current vehicle technology that already exists. Google already has automated cars driving around its campus in California, for example.</p>
<p>Illuminated markings and wind-powered lighting don’t just look neat, though. They also have massive safety and economic benefits. Extra lighting beside the highway and on the highway itself can significantly help drivers see at night. Additionally, with these features being both solar-powered and wind-powered, there will be little-to-no electricity costs in operating the roadway from day-to-day. Roosegaarde’s plans also help encourage the use of more environmentally-friendly energy sources by offering express induction charging lanes for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>In time, I really hope that Roosegaarde’s wish comes true and Smart Highways come to the United States and other places around the world. Considering that highways are public entities, though, I don’t see it happening anytime soon. Automobiles have advanced significantly through many years of development and corporate competition. Public highways don’t have the same type of driving force behind them (no pun intended). However, I’d like to see these worldwide national and private governments prove me wrong by implementing some new technology.</p>

<p>My name is Dylan Ebert and I’m a student at the University of Texas at Arlington. A recent seminar on the TxDOT and its problems and solutions brought some controversial thoughts to my mind, and I feel that many others may have similar, or differing, opinions on the issue. So I’ll take this opportunity to share my thoughts here on Road Crazed.</p>
<h3 id="The-Issue"><a href="#The-Issue" class="headerlink" title="The Issue"></a><strong>The Issue</strong></h3><p>There’s no question about it – the TxDOT (Texas Department of Transportation) is in trouble. In fact, they are in $12 billion of debt, and the Texas government insists upon bringing their borrowing to a halt. Not only that, but the conservative Texas government refuses to increase taxes to compensate. However, the population in Texas continues to boom, and with that, the road congestion. The past 10 years, the TxDOT has been borrowing money to undergo massive road construction projects in attempt to alleviate congestion on Texas roads and freeways, but they can no longer afford to continue doing so.</p>
<h3 id="TxDOT’s-Solution"><a href="#TxDOT’s-Solution" class="headerlink" title="TxDOT’s Solution"></a><strong>TxDOT’s Solution</strong></h3><p>Their solution is to continue building new roads, but to make them toll roads. High tolls would be present until the roads are paid for, then the tolls would be lowered to cover maintenance costs. In addition, the TxDOT is considering turning over many roads back to the local governments. What does this mean? Well, it means that the maintenance of certain roads, such as Division Street in Arlington, would be left to the city of Arlington. This proposed solution clearly isn’t popular with local government, but I would argue that there are far worse problems with their solution.</p>
<h3 id="The-Problem-with-Their-Solution"><a href="#The-Problem-with-Their-Solution" class="headerlink" title="The Problem with Their Solution"></a><strong>The Problem with Their Solution</strong></h3><p>First would be the sustainability of this solution. Constructing more and more new roads to keep up with the booming Texas economy just isn’t going to work forever. It’s a temporary fix to a continually growing problem. As new roads are constructed, traffic continues to get worse, and it’s an endless cycle of urban sprawl. Not only is this wasteful, but it has an even worse impact on the environment. More cars are having to commute further distances, and though these new megastructure tollways are making it possible, they aren’t compensating for Texas’ growing carbon footprint. While the outlook for the economy of Texas is bright, the more distant future looks bleak. As resources deplete and gas prices soar, the current mega-highway infrastructure just isn’t going to cut it.<br>Not only this, but there is a negative social impact of these new toll roads. TxDOT introduced the idea of managed lanes, in which drivers would be able to pay very high tolls during peak hours in order to be able to drive in a sort of “express lane”, if you will. This solution would give an advantage to wealthier commuters, and encourages social stratification. This massive abundance of concrete structures aren’t helping quality of life or the beauty of Texas itself, either. So, what should the TxDOT and Texas Government do?</p>
<h3 id="Proposed-Solution"><a href="#Proposed-Solution" class="headerlink" title="Proposed Solution"></a><strong>Proposed Solution</strong></h3><p>Let’s look at something that peers further into the future. Not only something that patches up the current congestion problem, but permanently remedies it. I would propose a congestion and/or gasoline tax, to encourage more efficient commuting habits such as carpooling and public transportation, and discourage the continual depletion of scarce resources. With this tax revenue, I would propose the implementation of more extensive public transportation – something that Texas is severely lacking in. This would decrease social stratification by providing more affordable transportation to the increasingly urban-dwelling Texas majority, decrease the carbon footprint, and decrease congestion on the roads. As more advanced systems develop throughout the world, public transportation gradually shows a brighter future than the wasteful, sprawling suburban-American infrastructure we see today. So, will Texas learn the hard way? Will decisions made in Texas government today have a devastating impact on the approaching green-oriented future? What would you propose?</p>

        <p>There’s been a bit of ruckus lately surrounding the unknown fate of the 1.4 miles of Interstate connecting U.S. 75 and I-45 in Dallas. Officially known as Interstate 345, most maps and even the signs on the road itself classify this short connector as Highway 75. However, its impact is much more significant than its presence on the maps. I-345 cuts right through downtown Dallas, and moves over <a href="http://www.dmagazine.com/Home/D_Magazine/2013/February/How_Dallas_is_Throwing_Away_4_Billion_Dollar_Investment.aspx">160,000 cars</a> per day. This entirely elevated urban freeway is in dire need of repair, though.</p>

        <p>Flying cars? Vacuum-powered trains? It’s hard to know what the future holds. However, it’s pretty clear that our modes of transportation are evolving and it’s not entirely impossible to predict where they’re going. While we might not see flying cars anywhere in the near future, we will see technology advance and make our commuting lives easier. Here’s my predictions about what we’ll see (and won’t see) in the next few decades:

<p>What do you get when you combine two major sports and entertainment attractions, a university with over 30,000 students, and no comprehensive system of public transportation? You get Arlington, Texas, of course! As a matter of fact, it the <em>largest city in the United States</em> with no public transportation. And with nearly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas#Demographics">400,000 people</a>, I wouldn’t exactly consider this an accomplishment to be proud of. But why is this a major issue, and what’s keeping mass transit out of Arlington? Read on to find out.

        <p>Sure, you may infinitely argue that your city has the worst traffic imaginable. And sure, it might actually be pretty bad. But there’s some places out there which have traffic problems that are even beyond the scope of our worst nightmares. Let’s take a look:</p>

        <p>So there I was, driving to school on the old two-lane Farm-to-Market Road coming out of my city. My drive for the first half-mile or so was somewhat pleasant until suddenly, out of nowhere, a visibly underpowered pickup truck towing an enormous travel trailer turned out in front of me. Thus, I was stuck behind this slow-moving atrocity until I arrived (late) at school, five miles later. I was going 40 miles an hour on the entire way, and guess what the speed limit is? 60.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is all too common of an occurrence. I’m stuck behind someone driving incredibly slowly on a two-lane highway, I can’t go around them because there’s too many cars coming the other direction, and for some reason they absolutely refuse to pull over into the shoulder so I can pass. Or worse, I’m driving on a road with <em>no shoulder</em> at all.
